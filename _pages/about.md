I am a PhD student in the [Cryptology and Data Security Group](https://crypto.unibe.ch/) at the University of Bern. My research focuses on improving the privacy and scalability of digital currencies, including both decentralized cryptocurrencies and centrally managed systems such as CBDCs. In this context, another of my concern is to meaningfully balance privacy and regulatory oversight.

More broadly, my interests include privacy-enhancing technologies and censorship-resistant systems, using cryptography and Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols.
